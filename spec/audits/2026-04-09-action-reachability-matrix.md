# Action Reachability Matrix

### State machine

```
open ──→ awaiting_entropy ──→ pending_entropy ──→ completed
  │              │                    │
  │              │                    └──→ failed
  │              └──→ failed
  │              └──→ completed (caller-seed via :execute from :locked)
  └──→ expired
```

### Internal-only actions

These have `forbid_if(always())` policies — only reachable via
`authorize?: false` (Oban workers, change modules):

- `transition_to_pending` (EntropyWorker)
- `execute_with_entropy` (EntropyWorker)
- `execute_drand_only` (EntropyWorker)
- `expire` (ExpiryWorker)
- `mark_failed` (EntropyWorker)

### DB trigger enforcement

The draws immutability trigger independently enforces:
- Terminal states (completed/failed/expired): all mutations blocked
- winner_count: immutable after creation
- entry_hash/entry_canonical/entries: immutable after open
- drand_round/drand_chain/weather_station/weather_time: immutable in awaiting_entropy/pending_entropy
- seed_source=caller blocked when drand_round is set
- State transitions validated (no backward transitions)

## SandboxDraw

| Action | Type | State filter | Policy | Writes | Change modules |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------------|
| `create` | create | — | actor_present | name, winner_count, entries, seed (hardcoded), results, executed_at | SetActorFields, ValidateEntries, ExecuteWithSandboxSeed, EmitCreateTelemetry |
| `read` | read | — | owner (api_key_id == actor) | — | — |

SandboxDraw is create-and-execute in one transaction. No state machine,
no receipts, no transparency log. Structurally incapable of being
confused with a real draw.

## Entry

| Action | Type | State filter | Policy | Writes | Change modules |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------------|
| `create` | create | — | **internal only** | draw_id, entry_id, weight | — |
| `destroy` | destroy | — | **internal only** | — | — |
| `read` | read | — | owner (draw.api_key_id == actor) | — | — |

Entry mutations are gated by the entries immutability trigger at the
DB level: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE blocked when draw status != open.

## Findings

**F-1: `:execute` action is valid but currently unreachable.**

The `:execute` action filters on `status == :locked`. No code path
currently produces `:locked` state — the `lock` action atomically
transitions `open → awaiting_entropy` because `LockDraw` and
`DeclareEntropy` run in the same Ash changeset (single SQL UPDATE).

This is intentional — the caller-seed path ("lock and wait") is a
future feature. To enable it, the `lock` action needs to be split
so draws can pause in `:locked` before entropy declaration. Filed
as a separate card.

The `:execute` action, `NoEntropyDeclared` validation, and `:locked`
status enum value are retained as forward-looking infrastructure.

**No security findings.** Every reachable action's state filter matches
its documented intent. The DB triggers independently enforce the same
constraints.
